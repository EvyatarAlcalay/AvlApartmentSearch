# AVL Apartment Search
This C++ project implements an AVL tree and a stack data structure to manage and search apartments by coordinates. It also includes a generic `find` function and a custom testing framework.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- **Apartment.cpp / Apartment.h** (Apartment class representing 2D coordinates)
- **AVL.cpp / AVL.h** (AVL Tree implementation with iterators)
- **Stack.cpp / Stack.h** (Stack implemented using templates)
- **Find.h** (Generic template find function)
- **main.cpp** (Program entry point)

## Testing Framework
- **test_runner.cpp / test_runner.h** (Custom test framework)
- **tests.cpp** (Unit tests)
- **CMakeLists.txt** (Build configuration)

## 📌 Notes
-The project is based on an academic exercise focused on AVL trees and algorithmic design.
